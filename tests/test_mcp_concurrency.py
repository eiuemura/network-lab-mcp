"""Step 3.3: concurrency proven at the actual MCP tool boundary, not merely
inside terminal.py's private helpers.

Investigation (see the Step 3.3 final report) found that the MCP SDK in use
(mcp==2.2.0) already dispatches each `tools/call` request as its own anyio
task (mcp.shared.jsonrpc_dispatcher.JSONRPCDispatcher._dispatch_request()
spawns rather than awaits, for every method except "initialize"), and that
a synchronous tool function -- every @mcp.tool() in mcp_server.py is a
plain `def`, not `async def` -- is invoked via
`anyio.to_thread.run_sync()` (mcp.server.mcpserver.utilities.func_metadata.
FuncMetadata.call_fn()), which offloads it to a real OS thread rather than
blocking the event loop. Two different-device tool calls can therefore
already overlap with zero changes to mcp_server.py's dispatch model.

These tests call `network_lab_mcp.mcp_server.mcp.call_tool(name, args)`
directly -- the same public, high-level entry point the framework's own
`_handle_call_tool()` calls for a real incoming `tools/call` JSON-RPC
request. This exercises the identical Tool.run() -> call_fn() ->
anyio.to_thread.run_sync() path a real concurrent client would, without
needing to also drive the stdio/JSON-RPC transport layer itself (pure
transport marshalling, irrelevant to the concurrency question)."""

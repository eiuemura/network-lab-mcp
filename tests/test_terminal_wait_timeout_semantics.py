"""Characterize `terminal._wait_for_pattern()`'s
current timeout semantics, with
deterministic tests (an injectable fake clock -- never a real 25-second
sleep) rather than inferring behavior from source inspection alone.

Investigation finding (see `_wait_for_pattern()`'s own body in
terminal.py): `deadline = time.monotonic() + timeout` is computed exactly
ONCE, and the poll loop condition is `while time.monotonic() < deadline`.
Nothing in the loop ever recomputes or extends `deadline` based on pane
content changing -- "activity" (the pane differing from `baseline_text`)
only ever *unlocks* whether a match is even considered (the stale-prompt
race guard), it never resets the timer. This is therefore a **FIXED TOTAL
DEADLINE**, not an inactivity timeout: continuously arriving, genuinely
changing terminal output does NOT postpone the timeout by even one
second -- only reaching the expected pattern before the deadline does.

Both Discovery's bootstrap login/command execution and managed
`terminal_open()`'s private authentication (`_authenticate_managed_
session()`) call this exact same shared primitive -- there is only one
command-wait implementation in the whole project, so this characterization
applies identically to every caller."""

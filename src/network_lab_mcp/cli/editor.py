"""External YAML editor support for topology/scenario/reference definitions.

Resolution order: $VISUAL, then $EDITOR, then a `vim` fallback. Network Lab
MCP never adds vim-specific *decorative* options (syntax highlighting /
filetype) when the operator explicitly chose an editor via $VISUAL/$EDITOR
-- those apply only to the fallback it selects itself. Paste mode is the
one exception: whichever editor is resolved (explicit or fallback), if its
executable is positively confirmed to be real Vim (see
`_is_confirmed_vim()`), `-c "set paste"` is appended so a multi-line YAML
paste into the editor never triggers Vim's autoindent-amplification on
every newline. This is a per-invocation Vim startup command, not a change
to any vimrc -- it affects only the one editor session this module launches.

The candidate flow is: committed definition -> candidate data -> a secure,
unique `.yaml` temporary file -> external editor -> (editor exits) -> read
the temporary file -> parse -> validate -> update the in-memory candidate.
Nothing under lab/ is touched here; only `commit` writes real YAML. The
temporary file is always removed, including on every error path, and is
never written to with world/group-readable permissions.

"""Per-device terminal concurrency.

Core invariant under test: different devices execute concurrently; the
same device's operations are serialized through one lock per underlying
tmux session name (terminal._session_lock()). Uses real tmux sessions (the
isolated network-lab-mcp socket, same as test_terminal_logging.py /
test_terminal_stale_prompt.py) so the actual check-then-act session
creation path is genuinely exercised -- never a real router:
`_build_transport_command` is monkeypatched to a safe local command
instead of ssh/telnet, so no network binary or connectivity is required.

Never touches the real repository's logs/ (LOGS_ROOT is monkeypatched to
an isolated temp directory, same convention as test_terminal_logging.py)."""

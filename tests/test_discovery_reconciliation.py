"""Link reconciliation (reconcile_links()) and unresolved-neighbor
evidence retention -- reciprocal LLDP observations collapse into one
physical link, parallel links between the same router pair stay distinct,
conflicting reciprocal observations are reported rather than silently
resolved, and an unresolved/external neighbor (e.g. the sanitized ASR9001
fixture) is retained as evidence without ever being added as a managed
topology device."""

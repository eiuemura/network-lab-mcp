"""Network Lab MCP stdio server.

Exposes exactly seven tools to Claude Code:

    get_active_topology()
    get_execution_instructions()
    terminal_open()
    terminal_send()
    terminal_read()
    terminal_list()
    terminal_close()

This process communicates over stdio, and stdout is reserved for MCP protocol
traffic. Diagnostic logging goes to stderr only; nothing is ever printed to
stdout.
